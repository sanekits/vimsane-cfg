" Extreme basics:
" ==============
"    Enter insert mode:     i
"    Leave insert mode:     <ESC>
"    Write file to disk:    :w[enter]
"    Change window right:   Ctrl+L
"    Change window left:    Ctrl+H
"    Exit vim:              :q[enter]

" What is vimsane?
" ================
" vimsane is a Bloomberg-oriented, pre-packaged Vim configuration offered
" to those who want to learn the Vim editor but don't understand Vim well
" enough to set it up sanely.
"
" Vim can be intimdating and frustrating to new users, and the learning
" curve is long, so Vimsane exists to help you become reasonably competent
" quickly. By bundling some help with a few popular vim plugins and sane
" configuration choices, the initial learning curve is made gentler for
" newcomers.
"
" While you can use vimsane as your daily editor for the long term, you're
" encouraged to learn how to customize and extend Vim, and you'll probably
" want to leave vimsane behind as you do that.  This is training wheels,
" not a racing bike.
"
" If you're brand new, it's recommended to print these instructions and
" keep them handy while you're working.

" Sales pitch:
" ============
" The time spend learning Vim is an investment. One must accept that
" productivity will drop before it recovers: ordinary things will take a
" long time, and you'll think 'I could have been done by now with a GUI
" editor!' 
"
" But that's a short-sighted viewpoint: yes, the GUI will get you to the
" boarding gate quicker, but it's a long flight.  Presumably you will be a
" software engineer for decades, and on that scale, the advantages of Vim
" proficiency will beat all GUI editor choices by a huge margin.
"
" With Vim, you and the editor will become a single deeply interwoven
" system that evolve together and go everywhere as a unit. You'll complete
" each other's thoughts, you'll share socks, you'll become Edward
" Scissorhands watching your ideas turn into code with no consciousness of
" the mechanical process involved. 
"
" Your hands and the keyboard will merge and you'll stop spending precious
" mental energy and movement time on the interface between your brain and
" the code.  No GUI will ever become a direct pipe from your mind to the
" text like that. This is why something as ugly and unfriendly as Vim
" continues to thrive year after year, even as wave after wave of sexier
" alternatives proliferate.
"
" So I encourage you to bite the bullet and take your pain -- learn The One
" True Editor(tm), and meld with the machine.  It only hurts for a while,
" and vimsane will reduce some of that sting. After that, you'll fly past
" your GUI-bound peers and smile with merciful pity in your eye: `you poor
" things!'

" What about emacs?
" ================= 
" Yes, there's another `editor' called emacs which has ensnared many of the
" unenlightened. `emacs' is an acronym that expands to various metaphors
" that express how it kills the spirit and pollutes the basic bodily
" fluids.  If you go that way, expect no mercy from the gods when your soul
" is finally judged.  But hey: it's a free country.

" Just the basic concepts:
" ========================

" Vim is a modal editor: the meaning of keys is radically affected by the
" current mode.  If you just start typing without knowing what mode you're
" in, you will almost surely be surprised by the outcome.
"
" There are two modes that are most important: 'normal' mode is anything
" but normal to those who arrive from other editors -- in normal mode, your
" fingers are talking to the control logic of the editor, issuing commands
" to move around in documents, change files, reposition windows, reformat,
" and so forth.  
"
" Everything in Vim is tuned to the idea that you do not want to move your
" hands far from the home row on the keyboard -- being a touch typist is
" pretty much assumed.  (Note: If you aren't a touch typist, and you've
" chosen programming as a career, stop worrying about Vim and learn to type
" properly first.) 
"
" Since there are a limited number of keys in close proximity to the home
" row, the meaning of those keys in normal mode is opaque and must be
" learned the old-fashioned way, but once learned, the practice of those
" operations is very efficient.
"
" The other really-important mode is 'insert mode': this is where you type
" and your keystrokes are mostly turned into text in an unsurprising way.
" Insert mode is not 'pure' -- Vim provides interpretation for certain key
" sequences that goes beyond simply 'insert the keystroke into the document
" as a character', and you can customize insert mode extensively too.
"
" But in general, you use insert mode to enter text, and you use normal
" mode to do almost everything else, and you switch between these modes
" rapidly and frequently... always aware of the current mode, your fingers
" learn patterns that encode this knowledge and you stop thinking about it
" after a while.
"
" Other modes you'll learn as you go. But when using Vim, the most important
" thing to know is `am I in insert mode or normal mode'? With vimsane,
" you'll see the text `--INSERT--' at the lower left corner of the window
" when you're insert mode.

" Practice as a practice:
" ======================
" Nobody can pour the Vim manual into their brain in a brief period of
" time.  You should expect that you'll learn stuff, use it on a daily
" basis, then learn more stuff and practice that to integrate it with your
" muscle memory.  This will occur over and over again -- each new wave of
" skills will make you more efficient, but you need to keep taking on those
" next waves: once you get competent at what you already know, reach out
" and grab some more tips and start using them on a daily basis.
"
" Practice is a long-term commitment here: if you get complacent and think
" `my Vim skills are good enough now', then you'll waste much of the power
" of Vim and not achieve the productivity gains that pay for the learning
" curve.  If that happens, then you've tormented yourself with an ugly
" editor in order to be no more productive than one of those GUI snails.

" About vimtutor
" ==============

" If you run 'vimtutor' from the unix shell, you'll get the classic vim
" tutor, which munges your configuration a bit and then loads a copy of a
" static tutorial file -- so you can mess up the file without losing
" anything important as you read and practice its instructions.
"
"   $ vimtutor
"
" This is worth 30 min of your time to practice the basic commands.  It
" doesn't go very deep, but it does a decent first whack and helps you to
" function in vim if you're totally new.
"
" Recommended: study the cheatsheet
" =================================
" https://github.com/sanekits/vimtips/blob/master/vim-cheatsheet.png


" Why CAPSLOCK is Satan:
" ====================== 

"  In Vim's normal mode, a capital letter has a completely different
"  meaning than a lower-case letter most of the time.  To maximize the
"  value of home-row proximity, many Vim (and emacs) programmers use their
"  operating system's keyboard controls to re-map the Capslock key to
"  become <ESC> or <CTRL>, which produces more efficient hand positioning
"  for rapid work.
"
"  But if the Vim user moves to a different computer, the Capslock becomes
"  Capslock again, and their hard-won finger skills become deadly:
"  accidentally hitting the Capslock key because they're used to it being
"  friendly, they decimate their document with errant capital letters in
"  normal mode.
"
"  My solution to this is analog but effective: I keep an office binder
"  clip with me, and break off the end of a wooden coffee stirrer, using
"  the pair to clamp the Capslock key into the inactive state.  While I
"  lose a bit of efficiency from the loss of my nearby <CTRL> key, I regain
"  my sanity by not throwing errant capital letters at normal mode.
"
"  Really, though, Capslock is a rarely used key that does not deserve such
"  a prominent and valuable piece of real estate on the keyboard, even for
"  non-Vim users.  If it must exist, it should be far from the home row.
"  That's why it's Satan: bad design, oft repeated.
"
"  There is another solution for those who use X-window terminals like
"  xterm or gnome-terminal: add the following to your shell's init file
"  (e.g. ~/.bashrc), to tell the X keyboard handler to ignore Capslock
"  by adding the following to your shell startup file (e.g. ~/.bashrc, 
"  ~/.kshrc, or  ~/.profile, etc)
"
"       xmodmap -e "remove lock = Caps_Lock"
"

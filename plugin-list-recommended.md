# vim Plugin Recommendations

## [vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

One of the most popular "plugin managers" for vim: a plugin which manages other plugins, making them easy to install/update, etc.  If you install this first, the
other plugins are easier to experiment with and set up.

## [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline)

Organizes the status bar with numerous extended features, colored indicators, etc.  Very popular and helpful.

## [nerdtree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree)

"File system explorer" for vim.  I use this every day.

## [bufexplorer](https://github.com/jlanzarotta/bufexplorer)

"Buffer explorer": often you have many open buffers, being able to
efficiently see them all and navigate them is simplified here.  I use this every day.

## [vim-peekaboo](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-peekaboo)

Dorky name, helpful tool: vim uses "registers" extensively to store text snippets, etc.  This lets you see those all in one place and adds some helpful shortcuts.

## [vim-easymotion](https://github.com/easymotion/vim-easymotion)

Vim's already-extensive navigation tools are extended another dimension.  A bit tricky to explain, but the web site has animated graphics to help.
